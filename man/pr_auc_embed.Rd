\title{Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve for an Embedding}
\usage{
pr_auc_embed(dm, labels)
}
\arguments{
\item{dm}{Distance matrix of an embedding.}

\item{labels}{Vector of labels for each observation in the dataset in the
same order as the observations in the distance matrix.}
}
\value{
Area Under the Precision-Recall curve, averaged over each
observation.
}
\description{
Embedding quality measure.
}
\details{
The PR curve plots precision (also known as positive predictive value, PPV)
against recall (also known as the true positive rate). The area under the
curve provides similar information compared to the area under the ROC curve,
but may be more appropriate when classes are highly imbalanced.

This function calculates the PR curve N times, where N is the number of the
observations. The label of the Nth observation is set as the positive class
and then the other observations are ranked according to their distance from
the Nth observation in the output coordinates (lower distances being better).
Observations with the same label as the Nth observation count as positive
observations. The final reported result is the average over all observations.

Perfect retrieval results in an AUC of 1. For random retrieval, the value
is the proportion of the positive class labels for that curve.
}
\note{
Use of this function requires that the \code{PRROC} package be
installed.
